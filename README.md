\section{introduction}
Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental and crucial technique in the field of video processing, which aims to generate intermediate frames between two consecutive frames in a video sequence. This process significantly enhances the visual quality of videos, offering smoother motion and a more immersive viewing experience \cite{huang2020rife,cheng2020video}. The significance of VFI extends across multiple domains, including video enhancement, slow - motion rendering, and video compression.

In the realm of video enhancement, VFI plays a pivotal role in improving the overall quality of videos. With the rapid development of high - definition and high - frame - rate displays, the demand for high - quality video content has soared. However, a large amount of existing video content is captured at relatively low frame rates. VFI can effectively increase the frame rate of these videos, reducing motion blur and judder, and making the video playback more fluid and natural \cite{danier2022st,lu2022video}. 

For slow - motion rendering, VFI is indispensable. Slow - motion videos are widely used in sports broadcasting, film production, and scientific research to capture and analyze fast - moving objects in detail. By generating additional frames between the original frames, VFI enables the creation of high - quality slow - motion videos without the need for high - speed cameras, which are often expensive and have limited availability \cite{reda2022film}.

In the area of video compression, VFI can be used for frame compensation. By interpolating frames, the amount of redundant information in the video can be reduced, which in turn improves the compression efficiency. This is particularly important in scenarios where bandwidth is limited, such as online video streaming and mobile video applications \cite{bao2019depth}.

Despite its numerous advantages, VFI faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the accurate estimation of complex motion. In real - world videos, objects often move in non - linear and complex ways, and existing methods often struggle to accurately estimate these motions, leading to problems such as blurring and ghosting in the interpolated frames \cite{xue2019video,zhu2023amt}. Another challenge is the issue of occlusion. When objects move, they may occlude each other, making it difficult to determine the correct pixel values for the interpolated frames \cite{jiang2018super,huang2022real}.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various methods. Traditional VFI methods, such as those based on optical flow, estimate the motion between frames by calculating the displacement of pixels. However, these methods often rely on linear or explicit motion assumptions, which are not suitable for complex motion scenarios \cite{huang2022real,zhu2023amt,reda2022film}. In recent years, deep - learning - based methods have shown great potential in VFI. These methods can learn complex motion patterns from large amounts of data, but they also face problems such as high computational complexity and the need for large - scale training data \cite{huang2020rife,cheng2020video,danier2022st,lu2022video}.

In conclusion, video frame interpolation is a vital technique in video processing with broad application prospects. However, there are still many challenges to be overcome. Future research should focus on developing more accurate and efficient VFI methods to meet the growing demand for high - quality video content.

In recent years, the demand for high - quality video content has been on a significant rise. With the rapid development of streaming platforms, virtual reality (VR), and high - definition displays, viewers now expect videos with smoother motion, higher frame rates, and enhanced visual fidelity \cite{argaw2022long,zhou2023exploring}. This increasing demand is driven by several factors, including the growth of online video consumption, the popularity of immersive entertainment experiences, and the continuous improvement of display technologies.

Video frame interpolation (VFI) plays a crucial role in meeting this demand. VFI is the process of generating intermediate frames between existing frames in a video sequence, effectively increasing the frame rate and enhancing the smoothness of motion. By filling in the gaps between frames, VFI can transform a low - frame - rate video into a high - frame - rate one, providing a more immersive and engaging viewing experience \cite{chan2021basicvsr,argaw2022long}.

One of the key applications of VFI is in slow - motion video production. Slow - motion videos are widely used in sports broadcasts, action movies, and special effects, as they can capture and showcase details that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. VFI enables the creation of high - quality slow - motion videos by generating additional frames, allowing for a more fluid and realistic representation of fast - moving objects \cite{jiang2018super,reda2022film}.

In addition to slow - motion video production, VFI also has important applications in video compression and frame rate conversion. In video compression, VFI can be used to reduce the amount of data required to represent a video sequence by removing redundant frames and generating new frames through interpolation. This can significantly reduce the storage space and bandwidth requirements of videos, making it easier to stream and distribute high - quality video content over the internet \cite{bao2019depth,niklaus2020softmax}.

Frame rate conversion is another important application of VFI. Different video sources may have different frame rates, and VFI can be used to convert videos from one frame rate to another, ensuring compatibility with different display devices and playback systems. For example, VFI can be used to convert a 24 - frame - per - second (fps) video to a 60 - fps video, providing a smoother viewing experience on high - frame - rate displays \cite{huang2020rife,cheng2020video}.

However, despite its many benefits, accurate frame interpolation remains a challenging task. One of the main challenges is the accurate estimation of complex motion. In real - world scenarios, objects in a video can move in various ways, including linear, non - linear, and even discontinuous motions. Existing VFI methods often assume that the motion between frames is uniform and linear, which may not hold true in many cases. As a result, these methods may produce inaccurate flow maps and generate interpolated frames with artifacts such as blurring and ghosting \cite{xue2019video,park2021asymmetric}.

Another challenge is the handling of occlusion. When objects move in a video, they may occlude each other, making it difficult to accurately estimate the motion and appearance of the occluded regions. Existing VFI methods often struggle to handle occlusion effectively, resulting in poor - quality interpolated frames in occluded areas \cite{jiang2018super,huang2022real}.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed a variety of VFI methods. These methods can be broadly classified into several categories, including traditional methods, deep - learning - based methods, and hybrid methods. Traditional VFI methods typically rely on hand - crafted features and motion models to estimate the motion between frames and generate interpolated frames. These methods are often computationally efficient but may not be able to handle complex motion and occlusion effectively \cite{niklaus2017video,niklaus2018context}.

Deep - learning - based VFI methods, on the other hand, use neural networks to learn the mapping between input frames and interpolated frames directly from data. These methods have shown great promise in recent years, as they can automatically learn complex motion patterns and handle occlusion more effectively. However, deep - learning - based methods often require large amounts of training data and computational resources, and they may also be sensitive to overfitting \cite{liu2017video,lee2020adacof}.

Hybrid VFI methods combine the advantages of traditional and deep - learning - based methods. These methods typically use traditional methods to estimate the initial motion and appearance of the interpolated frames and then use deep - learning - based methods to refine the results. Hybrid methods can achieve a good balance between computational efficiency and interpolation quality \cite{bao2019depth,niklaus2020softmax}.

In conclusion, the increasing demand for high - quality video content has made VFI an important research area. VFI can enhance the viewing experience by increasing the frame rate, improving the smoothness of motion, and reducing artifacts in videos. However, accurate frame interpolation remains a challenging task, and further research is needed to develop more effective VFI methods that can handle complex motion and occlusion more effectively.

Video frame interpolation (VFI) has emerged as a pivotal research area in computer vision, with far - reaching implications for various applications such as video enhancement, slow - motion rendering, and frame rate conversion \cite{huang2022real,cheng2020video,danier2022st}. The purpose of this literature review is to comprehensively summarize the existing research on video frame interpolation, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state - of - the - art, identify challenges, and point out future research directions.

In recent years, the demand for high - quality video content has skyrocketed, driven by the rapid development of multimedia platforms and devices. VFI plays a crucial role in meeting this demand by generating intermediate frames between existing frames, thereby enhancing the smoothness and visual quality of videos. However, achieving accurate and efficient VFI remains a challenging task due to the complexity of motion estimation and the presence of various artifacts such as blurring and ghosting.

The existing research on VFI can be broadly classified into several categories. Traditional video frame interpolation methods, which include feature extraction, correspondence estimation, image warping, and frame synthesis steps based on optical flow calculations, have laid the foundation for this field \cite{huang2022real,li2023amt,reda2022film}. For example, the method proposed by Zhewei Huang et al. \cite{huang2022real} uses real - time intermediate flow estimation for video frame interpolation, achieving real - time performance. Zhen Li et al. \cite{li2023amt} adopted all - pairs multi - field transforms for efficient frame interpolation, improving the efficiency of the interpolation process. And Fitsum Reda et al. \cite{reda2022film} developed a method for frame interpolation for large motion, which can handle a certain degree of large - motion frame interpolation.

With the advent of deep learning, a new generation of VFI methods has emerged. These methods can be further divided into sub - categories such as those based on flow, kernel, and diffusion models. Flow - based methods, like the one in \"Video enhancement with task - oriented flow\" \cite{xue2019video}, introduce bidirectional optical flow for motion estimation, but they often suffer from inaccurate pixel offsets and artifacts, especially when there is a significant time - dynamic dependence between input frames. Kernel - based methods, such as the work by Simon Niklaus et al. \cite{niklaus2017video}, use adaptive separable convolution for video frame interpolation, providing a new perspective but still facing limitations in handling complex motions and time - dependent problems.

Diffusion - based models have also shown great potential in VFI. For instance, Duolikun Danier et al. \cite{danier2023ldmvfi} used latent diffusion models for video frame interpolation, and Jonathan Ho et al. \cite{ho2022video} proposed a video diffusion model with interpolation and classifier - free guidance mechanisms, offering new frameworks for VFI.

Despite the significant progress made in VFI research, several challenges still remain. Many existing methods assume uniform linear motion between frames, which is far from the complex and non - linear motions in real - world scenarios. Moreover, the problem of artifacts such as blurring and ghosting has not been fully resolved, which seriously affects the visual quality of the interpolated frames.

In conclusion, this literature review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the existing research on video frame interpolation. By analyzing the advantages and limitations of different methods, we can better understand the current situation of this field and provide valuable insights for future research. Future work should focus on developing more robust and accurate methods that can handle complex motions and reduce artifacts, thereby further improving the performance of video frame interpolation.

\subsection{Traditional Frame Interpolation Algorithms}

Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental task in the field of video processing, which aims to generate intermediate frames between two consecutive frames in a video sequence. Traditional frame interpolation algorithms have played a crucial role in the development of VFI techniques. This section provides a comprehensive review of these traditional algorithms, including their key methods, performance improvements, and limitations.

\subsubsection{Key Progress in Traditional Frame Interpolation Algorithms}
Traditional frame interpolation algorithms can be broadly classified into several categories, such as optical flow-based methods, kernel-based methods, and methods combining flow and kernel. These algorithms have made significant progress in improving the quality and efficiency of video frame interpolation.

#### Optical Flow-based Methods
Optical flow-based methods estimate the motion between consecutive frames by calculating the optical flow, which represents the apparent motion of objects in the video. One of the early works in this area is the method proposed by Xue et al. \cite{xue2019video}, which introduced bidirectional optical flow for motion estimation in video frame interpolation. This method achieved the motion estimation process for video frame interpolation. Another notable work is the real-time intermediate flow estimation method by Huang et al. \cite{huang2022real}, which designed a privileged distillation scheme optimized by ground truth to accurately train the intermediate flow model, improving the accuracy of optical flow estimation.

However, these optical flow-based methods also have some limitations. For example, they often suffer from inaccurate pixel offsets, resulting in ghosting or blurring artifacts, especially when there is a significant time dynamic dependence between input frames \cite{xue2019video, park2021asymmetric, cheng2020multi, huang2022real, kong2022ifrnet}.

#### Kernel-based Methods
Kernel-based methods introduce convolution operations based on kernels to expand the receptive field of motion estimation with relatively low computational burden. For instance, Niklaus et al. \cite{niklaus2017video} proposed a method using adaptive separable convolution for video frame interpolation. This method provided a new idea for video frame interpolation by dynamically matching the visual scene and complex motion. Lee et al. \cite{lee2020adacof} designed the AdaCoF model, which supplemented the offset vector coefficients of kernel estimation to adapt to the motion characteristics between frames.

Despite these improvements, kernel-based methods still face challenges. They often assume linear motion between input frames and have limitations in exploring high-order information. Moreover, they may not fully consider the continuous change and recursion of motion \cite{niklaus2017video, lee2020adacof, cheng2022multiple, shi2022video, ding2021cdfi}.

#### Methods Combining Flow and Kernel
Some methods combine the advantages of optical flow and kernel-based approaches. For example, Bao et al. \cite{bao2019depth} explored depth information to explicitly detect occlusions and developed a depth back-projection layer to synthesize intermediate flow and learn hierarchical features. This method was able to explicitly detect occlusions and synthesize output frames in video frame interpolation.

\subsubsection{Representative Methods and Their Limitations}
#### Representative Methods
- **Super SloMo**: Jiang et al. \cite{jiang2018super} proposed the Super SloMo method, which used an optical flow estimation network and calculated an occlusion map to generate multiple intermediate frames. This method could generate multiple intermediate frames and improve the quality of video frame interpolation.
- **BMBC**: Park et al. \cite{park2020bmbc} constructed a bilateral motion network and used a bilateral cost to accurately estimate bilateral motion. They also developed a dynamic filter generation network to generate intermediate frames. This method accurately estimated bilateral motion and generated intermediate frames.

#### Limitations
Most traditional frame interpolation algorithms assume uniform linear motion between frames and do not fully consider the motion correlation in the time dimension of multivariate regression. As a result, they have difficulty accurately describing the non-linear situations in real scenarios. For example, in complex motion scenes with large displacements, rotations, or deformations, these algorithms may produce inaccurate interpolation results, such as ghosting, blurring, or artifacts \cite{xue2019video, park2021asymmetric, cheng2020multi, huang2022real, kong2022ifrnet}.

In conclusion, traditional frame interpolation algorithms have made important contributions to the field of video frame interpolation. However, they still face challenges in dealing with complex motion and non-linear scenarios. Future research should focus on developing more advanced algorithms that can better handle these challenges and improve the quality and efficiency of video frame interpolation.

\subsection{Deep Learning - based Frame Interpolation Methods}

Deep learning - based frame interpolation methods have witnessed significant advancements in recent years, aiming to generate high - quality intermediate frames between two given frames. These methods can be broadly classified into several categories, each with its own characteristics, advantages, and limitations.

\subsubsection{1. Flow - based Methods}
Flow - based methods are among the most popular approaches in video frame interpolation. They rely on estimating the optical flow between frames to predict the motion of objects and then use this motion information to generate intermediate frames.

For example, in the work of Xue et al. \cite{xue2019video}, they introduced a sub - module pre - trained on the MPI - Sintel dataset to estimate the flow field of the intermediate frame and incorporated it into the VFI model for joint training. This approach improved the video enhancement effect. However, these methods often suffer from issues such as inaccurate pixel offset, resulting in ghosting or blurring artifacts, especially when there is a significant time - dynamic dependence between input frames \cite{xue2019video, park2021asymmetric, cheng2020multi, huang2022real, kong2022ifrnet}.

Another notable work is by Huang et al. \cite{huang2022real}, who designed a privileged distillation scheme optimized by ground truth to accurately train the intermediate flow model, which improved the accuracy of optical flow estimation. But it also had a high computational cost.

\subsubsection{2. Kernel - based Methods}
Kernel - based methods introduce convolution operations based on kernels to expand the receptive field of motion estimation with relatively low computational burden.

Niklaus et al. \cite{niklaus2017video} used two separate vectors' outer product to replace the large convolution kernel of AdaConv, significantly reducing the computational cost. Lee et al. \cite{lee2020adacof} used deformable convolutions to provide spatial offsets for all weights in the kernel, breaking the motion range limitation of the kernel.

However, these methods still have limitations. They often assume linear motion between input frames and do not fully explore high - order information. Also, they have time - dependence limitations in kernel - level motion estimation and do not consider the recursion of continuous changes \cite{niklaus2017video, lee2020adacof, cheng2022multiple, shi2022video, ding2021cdfi}.

\subsubsection{3. Interpolation Modeling Methods}
Interpolation modeling methods focus on innovating in interpolation modeling based on existing motion to simulate long - term dynamic consistency.

Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2023exploring} developed a texture consistency loss to ensure that the interpolated content maintains a similar structure to the corresponding part, improving the quality of interpolated frames. Argaw et al. \cite{argaw2022long} addressed the problem of long - distance video frame interpolation by performing the motion of the current interpolation in the same direction as the reference frame when there is a large gap between input frames.

Nevertheless, these methods still have room for improvement. Due to the lack of full consideration of complex models in real - world scenarios, the performance of video frame interpolation is still limited \cite{zhou2023exploring, argaw2022long, chan2021basicvsr, xu2019quadratic, dutta2022non}.

\subsubsection{4. Limitations and Future Directions}
Although deep - learning based frame interpolation methods have achieved remarkable results, there are still several limitations. Most existing methods assume linear or simple motion between frames, which is insufficient to handle complex, non - linear, or blurred motions in real - world videos. Additionally, issues such as ghosting, blurring, and inaccurate motion estimation still persist.

In the future, more advanced models and algorithms need to be developed to better handle complex motions, such as non - linear and discontinuous motions. Incorporating more prior knowledge and using more sophisticated loss functions may also help to improve the performance of frame interpolation methods. Moreover, exploring the combination of different methods and leveraging the advantages of each may lead to more effective solutions.

\subsection{Applications of Video Frame Interpolation}

Video frame interpolation (VFI) has emerged as a pivotal technique in the field of computer vision, with a wide range of applications that span across multiple domains. This review delves into the diverse applications of VFI, highlighting the key methods and their limitations.

\subsubsection{Video Enhancement and Slow - motion Rendering}
One of the most prominent applications of VFI is video enhancement and slow - motion rendering. In the era of high - quality video content, users demand smoother and more immersive viewing experiences. VFI can significantly enhance the visual quality of videos by increasing the frame rate. For instance, traditional videos with a low frame rate often appear choppy, especially during fast - moving scenes. By inserting intermediate frames, VFI can transform these videos into high - frame - rate content, providing a more fluid and realistic viewing experience \cite{huang2022real}.

Slow - motion rendering is another area where VFI shines. It allows filmmakers and content creators to capture and present moments in exquisite detail. For example, in sports events, slow - motion replays generated through VFI can help viewers analyze the actions of athletes more closely, such as the trajectory of a ball or the movement of a player's body. However, existing methods in this area often face challenges. Many traditional VFI methods assume linear or simple motion between frames, which can lead to inaccurate interpolation in complex motion scenarios. For example, in scenes with rapid changes in direction or high - speed motion, the interpolated frames may contain artifacts such as blurring or ghosting \cite{cheng2020video}.

\subsubsection{Video Compression}
VFI also plays a crucial role in video compression. In video compression, reducing the amount of data while maintaining high - quality video is a constant challenge. VFI can be used to reduce the redundancy between frames. By interpolating frames, the number of frames that need to be stored or transmitted can be reduced, thereby saving storage space and bandwidth. For example, in some video compression standards, VFI can be used to predict intermediate frames based on key frames, which can significantly improve the compression ratio.

However, the accuracy of VFI in compression applications is of utmost importance. If the interpolated frames are inaccurate, it can lead to a significant degradation in video quality during decompression. Some existing VFI methods for compression may not be able to handle complex motion and occlusion well, resulting in visible artifacts in the decompressed video \cite{bao2019depth}.

\subsubsection{Frame Restoration}
In the field of frame restoration, VFI can be used to recover lost or damaged frames. For example, in old or degraded videos, some frames may be missing or corrupted. VFI can estimate the missing frames based on the surrounding frames, thereby restoring the integrity of the video. This is particularly useful in the preservation of historical and cultural video materials.

Nonetheless, frame restoration using VFI is a challenging task. The quality of the restored frames depends on the accuracy of the interpolation algorithm and the quality of the surrounding frames. In cases where the surrounding frames are also of poor quality or contain complex motion, it becomes difficult to accurately estimate the missing frames. Some existing methods may not be able to handle these complex situations effectively, resulting in sub - optimal restoration results \cite{xu2019quadratic}.

\subsubsection{Virtual and Augmented Reality}
In virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications, VFI can enhance the realism and immersion of the virtual environment. In VR/AR, a high frame rate is essential to reduce motion sickness and provide a smooth visual experience. VFI can increase the frame rate of the rendered virtual scenes, making the virtual environment more responsive and realistic.

However, the real - time performance of VFI is a critical requirement in VR/AR applications. Many existing VFI methods are computationally expensive and may not be able to meet the real - time requirements of VR/AR systems. Additionally, the complex motion and dynamic nature of VR/AR scenes pose challenges to the accuracy of VFI algorithms \cite{liu2020enhanced}.

In conclusion, the applications of VFI are vast and diverse, but there are still many challenges to be addressed. Future research should focus on developing more accurate, efficient, and robust VFI algorithms to meet the requirements of different applications.
